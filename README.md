Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Core and Client portions
of the Buttplug Sex Toy Control Protocol. It allows users to write
applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such as the
[Intiface Desktop
Application](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop) or Intiface
[C# CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-cli-csharp) or [Node
CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-cli-node).

A python-based Buttplug server is certainly possible, and may happen
in the future. For the moment, we are mostly trying to make it easier
for people to write Buttplug applications in python that can access
the already existing server implementations.
