Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Core and Client portions
of the Buttplug Sex Toy Control Protocol. It allows users to write
applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such as the
[Buttplug Windows Suite
Server](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-windows-suite) or the
[buttplug-js node
server](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-websocket-server).

While a python-based Buttplug server is certainly possible, and may
happen in the future, right now we are mostly trying to make it easier
for people to write Buttplug applications in python, and that doesn't
require a server implementation.
