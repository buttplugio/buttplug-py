### THIS VERSION OF BUTTPLUG-PY IS DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF [COMMUNITY MAINTAINED LIBRARIES](https://github.com/buttplugio/awesome-buttplug#python). 

The community maintained library brings in support for Buttplug Spec v3, as well as many nice to have features. It is recommended to use that instead of this library.

## Old Intro

Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Core and Client portions of the Buttplug Sex Toy
Control Protocol. It allows users to write applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such
as the [Intiface Desktop Application](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop) or [Intiface Rust CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-cli-rs).

For more information on the Buttplug project, check out the project website at
