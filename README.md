Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Core and Client portions of the Buttplug Sex Toy
Control Protocol. It allows users to write applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such
as the [Intiface Desktop Application](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop) or [Intiface Rust CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-cli-rs).

For more information on the Buttplug project, check out the project website at

## NO LONGER DEPRECATED

If you're thinking "but wasn't buttplug-py deprecated?"... Yeah it was but honestly it works and converting to the new rust FFI is going to take a while and it hasn't been on my todo list in well over a year, so we'll actually just call this still in production for now.
